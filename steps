If you know the orignal project scope which were mentioned in the document. We were supposed to implement email payload from RabbitMQ queue.
You have made some Rest API"s for that. Instead of using REST API's to get Email payload we need to pull payload from RabbitMQ queue.
You can keep existing Rest API's for that. But we need to pull payload from RabbitMQ queue. Once we get payload from RabbitMQ queue we need to process 
it and send email.

Remember every sent mail will logged in the outbox table and we need to pull payload from RabbitMQ queue and process it and send email. 
Here i am attaching paload parameters for the email from RabbitMQ queue.

{
    "tenant_id": "01996243-2d8c-726d-a5c2-81b7005ce9a2",
    "provider_id": "01996243-2da2-72b2-80c2-9d3f855e404a",
    "from": "noreply@yourcms.com",
    "to": ["customer@example.com"],
    "subject": "Welcome Email",
    "body_format": "HTML",
    "body_content": "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thank you for signing up.</p>"
}

Here Provider id means Active SMTP Provider in the database under the tenant. For now you can use default Active SMTP Provider to test the email sending functionality.
